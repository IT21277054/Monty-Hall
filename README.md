# Monty-Hall
The Monty Hall App is a web application being developed using Angular and .NET Core, designed to simulate and explore the famous Monty Hall problem. This application leverages the power of Angular, a widely-used JavaScript framework for building dynamic web applications, to create an intuitive and interactive user interface. The back-end of the app is developed using .NET Core, a cross-platform framework for building robust and scalable applications.

The Monty Hall problem is a probability puzzle named after the host of the popular game show "Let's Make a Deal," Monty Hall. The problem involves a scenario where a contestant is presented with three doors, behind one of which is a valuable prize, while the other two doors hide nothing. After the contestant chooses a door, the host, who knows what is behind each door, opens one of the remaining doors that does not have the prize. The contestant is then given the option to switch their initial choice or stick with it.

This app provides users with an opportunity to explore the Monty Hall problem through simulations. Users can interact with the app's intuitive user interface, make their initial door selections, and choose whether to switch their selection or stay with it. The app then runs simulations based on these choices, providing insights into the probability outcomes and helping users understand the mathematical reasoning behind the problem.
